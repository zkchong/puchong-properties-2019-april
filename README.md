Puchong properties on 2019 April.

Real estate is one of the favorite investments for working folks in Malaysia. As part of the data savvy company, the data engineering team harvested the prices of Puchong properties from one of the famous properties website. 

Like you guys, we have a lot of questions in our mind:
	1. Do all the properties share about the same price per square foot (psf)  if they are located at about the same area with about same number of rooms?
	2. Will the psf be slightly higher if they are located near to the main road?
	3. Which properties should I invest ? 

We can't answer of all them.

Hence, we decided to share the extracted data (Puchong area only) at github. May all the mighty data scientists to plot their best insight.
